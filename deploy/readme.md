## DEPLOYMENT

## CONTENT

- Deploying an Angular application involves several steps to ensure that your application is properly deployed and accessible to users. Here's a general outline of the deployment process:

    This command 
compiles an angular application/library into an output directory named 
dist at the given path. This command is used when you’re ready to build 
our application and deploy it.

```bash
ng build --configuration=environment_name
Build the Application:
    Use the Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) to build your application for production. Run the following command
ng build --prod
ng build --configuration production
This will create a dist folder containing the compiled and optimized version of your application.
```

**Example:**

Consider that I have three environments like qa for testing , dev for development, and prod for production as below:

**Configure Base Href:**

    If your Angular application will be hosted in a subdirectory or a specific domain path, configure the baseHref in the angular.json or angular-cli.json file:
    
    json
    
    "build": {
      "options": {
        "baseHref": "/your-subdirectory/"
      }
    }

**Set Up Server Configuration (Optional):** If your application uses Angular Router for routing, make sure your server is configured to handle deep linking and route requests correctly. For example, if using Apache, you might need to configure .htaccess rules for this.

**Serve the Application:**

Serve the application using a static file server. You can use a variety of options:
    **Node.js Server:** Use a simple Node.js server like http-server to serve the dist folder.
   **Nginx:**  Configure Nginx to serve your Angular application. This can provide better performance and caching.
    Firebase Hosting: If you're using Firebase, you can deploy your application using Firebase Hosting.

**Configure HTTPS (Optional):** For security reasons, it's recommended to serve your application over HTTPS. You can set up an SSL certificate on your server or use a service like Let's Encrypt.

**Domain and DNS Setup:** If you have a custom domain for your application, configure DNS settings to point to the IP address of your server or hosting platform.

**Load Balancing (Optional):** If you expect high traffic or need improved availability, consider using load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple instances of your application.

**Content Delivery Network (CDN) (Optional):** To improve the delivery speed of your application, consider using a CDN to cache and serve static assets globally.

**Gzip and Compression:** Enable Gzip compression on your server to reduce the size of transferred files, which can improve loading times.

**Monitor and Analytics:** Integrate monitoring and analytics tools to track user interactions, performance, and errors. Services like Google Analytics can provide valuable insights.

**Backup and Disaster Recovery:** Set up regular backups of your application files and any associated data to ensure recovery in case of failures.

**Testing:** Thoroughly test your application in a production-like environment before deploying to catch any issues.

**Deployment Automation (Optional)**:Implement a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the deployment process whenever code changes are pushed.

**Security Hardening:**

    Implement security best practices such as using secure HTTP headers, keeping dependencies updated, and applying security patches.

### RUN ANGULAR APPLICATION IN LOCAL

Install **http-server** globally

`npm install http-server -g`

Then inside the project directory (in the terminal), I run

`http-server dist/[your-project-name]`

### MAINTENANCE

Maintaining a Spring Boot application involves a combination of tasks that help keep your application running smoothly, securely, and efficiently over time. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to maintain your Spring Boot application effectively:

### 1. **Regular Updates and Maintenance:**

- **Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date:** Regularly update your project dependencies, including Spring Boot, libraries, and frameworks, to benefit from bug fixes, security patches, and new features.

- **Code Refactoring:** Periodically review your codebase for code smells, duplicate code, and areas for improvement. Refactor your code to improve readability, maintainability, and performance.

- **Review and Optimize Database Queries:** Review database queries and optimize them for performance. Use tools like Hibernate's query profiling or database monitoring tools.

- **Monitor Logs:** Continuously monitor application logs for errors, exceptions, and performance bottlenecks. Use logging frameworks like Logback or Log4j and integrate log aggregation tools.

### 2. **Security:**

- **Keep Security Libraries Updated:** Regularly update security-related libraries to patch vulnerabilities.

- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Perform regular vulnerability scans on your application and its dependencies. Use tools like OWASP Dependency-Check.

- **Security Testing:** Conduct security testing, including penetration testing, to identify vulnerabilities in your application.

- **Implement Security Best Practices:** Follow security best practices such as input validation, output encoding, proper authentication, and authorization mechanisms.

### 3. **Monitoring and Performance:**

- **Application Performance Monitoring (APM):** Use APM tools like New Relic, AppDynamics, or Prometheus to monitor application performance, identify bottlenecks, and optimize code.

- **Metrics and Analytics:** Implement metrics and monitoring for key application metrics such as response times, error rates, and resource utilization.

- **Load Testing:** Conduct load testing to assess your application's performance under various user loads.

### 4. **Backup and Disaster Recovery:**

- **Regular Backups:** Implement a regular backup strategy for both your application files and your database.

- **Disaster Recovery Plan:** Develop a disaster recovery plan that outlines steps to take in case of unexpected failures or data loss.

### 5. **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):**

- **Automated Testing:** Implement automated unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests as part of your CI/CD pipeline.

- **Continuous Integration:** Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, building, and deploying your application.

- **Continuous Deployment:** Automate deployment to different environments using CI/CD practices.

### 6. **Documentation:**

- **Documentation Maintenance:** Keep your application's documentation up-to-date, including installation instructions, usage guidelines, and API documentation.

- **Change Logs:** Maintain detailed change logs to keep track of feature additions, bug fixes, and improvements.

### 7. **Scalability:**

- **Auto-scaling:** Design your application to handle increased loads by utilizing auto-scaling mechanisms.

- **Load Balancing:** Implement load balancing to distribute traffic evenly among multiple instances of your application.

### 8. **Regular Testing:**

- **Regression Testing:** Continuously perform regression testing to ensure that new changes do not break existing functionality.

- **User Acceptance Testing:** Conduct user acceptance testing to involve stakeholders and ensure the application meets their requirements.

### 9. **User Feedback:**

- **Collect Feedback:** Encourage users to provide feedback and report issues. Actively address user concerns and prioritize improvements.

### 10. **Version Control and Git:**

- **Version Control:** Use version control systems like Git to track changes, collaborate with your team, and manage code history.

### 11. **Employee Knowledge:**

- **Knowledge Sharing:** Maintain documentation and conduct knowledge-sharing sessions to ensure team members are aware of application intricacies
