## 1. Form Management

Angular Forms, whether Reactive or Template-Driven, are essential for capturing user input.

> Instead of manually subscribing to form control value changes or using `valueChanges`,
>  Signals can represent form control values. This ensures that only 
> relevant components or parts of your application react to changes in 
> form values, making form handling more efficient.

Angular’s Forms module, be it 
Reactive or Template-Driven, is a core part of many applications, 
ensuring seamless user data input. With the introduction of Angular 
Signals, developers can further enhance the efficiency and simplicity of
 form handling.

### Reactive Form Handling with Signals

Consider a typical reactive form setup; with Angular Signals, you can use the `toSignal` function to represent form control values as signals. This ensures that
 only relevant components or parts of your application react to changes 
in form values.

Let’s create an example component with a form that uses Angular Signals:

```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { FormBuilder, FormGroup } from '@angular/forms';
import { toSignal } from '@angular/core/rxjs-interop';

@Component({
  template: `
    <form [formGroup]="profileForm">
      <label>
        First Name:
        <input type="text" formControlName="firstName">
      </label>
      <label>
        Last Name:
        <input type="text" formControlName="lastName">
      </label>
      <div *ngIf="firstNameSignal()">{{ firstNameSignal() }} is a great name!</div>
    </form>
  `,
})
export class ProfileEditorComponent {
  profileForm: FormGroup;
  // Represent the 'firstName' form control as a Signal
  firstNameSignal = toSignal(this.profileForm.get('firstName').valueChanges, {initialValue: ''});
  constructor(private fb: FormBuilder) {
    this.profileForm = this.fb.group({
      firstName: [''],
      lastName: ['']
    });
  }
}
```

Angular component with form utilizing Signals

In the example above, `firstNameSignal` is created using the `toSignal` function. It represents the value of the 'firstName' form control. Now, instead of manually subscribing to the `valueChanges` of the form control, we directly use the signal in our template. The 
div containing the compliment message for the first name will only be 
rendered or updated when the first name changes. More than that, we can 
have computed signals that would have an effect on our template. For 
example, we can have a form field with the date of birth, which is 
converted to a [writable signal](https://angular.io/guide/signals?ref=hackernoon.com#writable-signals) using `toSignal`. And another [computed signal](https://angular.io/guide/signals?ref=hackernoon.com#computed-signals) that would calculate and show the age based on the date of birth signal.

### Benefits Unveiled:

- **Selective Rendering:** Only the parts of your 
  application that rely on a specific signal will update when its value 
  alters. While not a virtual DOM like React, it does offer focused 
  template updates.
- **Smart Subscription Handling:** The `toSignal` function has got your back! It subscribes when a component starts and 
  unsubscribes upon its demise, safeguarding against memory leaks.
- **Crystal-clear Code:** No more murky waters! With Signals, dynamic values within Angular templates become straightforward and intuitive.

In essence, integrating Angular 
Signals with forms amplifies their performance and paves the way for a 
more organized, maintainable coding experience.

## 2. Live Data Streams

Applications like stock trading platforms or live sports scoreboards require real-time data updates.

> By integrating with RxJS through the `toSignal` function, 
> Angular Signals can directly represent these data streams. This means 
> that as new data is streamed in, only the affected components get 
> updated, ensuring optimal performance.

Modern [web applications](https://hackernoon.com/the-perfume-of-web-applications-in-an-evolving-field-navigating-trends-and-tech?ref=hackernoon.com) often deal with dynamic data that constantly updates in real-time. Such
 live data streams are typically used in stock trading platforms, sports
 scoreboards, live chat applications, and more. Angular Signals can be 
incredibly effective in these scenarios, ensuring that data remains 
reactive and synchronizes with the UI seamlessly.

### Handling Live Data with Angular Signals

Traditionally, managing live data streams might involve services, 
observables, and complex subscription logic. Now, let’s reimagine this 
using Angular Signals:

Chat Service with Signals

```ts
import { Injectable, OnDestroy, signal } from '@angular/core';
import { webSocket } from 'rxjs/webSocket';
import { Subscription } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class ChatService implements OnDestroy {
  socketSubs: Subscription;
  messagesSignal = signal<string[]>([]);
  private socket$ = webSocket('ws://chatserver.com');

  constructor() {
    this.socketSubs = this.socket$.subscribe(
      message => this.messagesSignal.mutate(messages => messages.push(message))
    );
  }
  sendMessage(msg: string) {
    this.socket$.next(msg);
  }
  ngOnDestroy() {
    this.socketSubs?.unsubscribe();
  }
}
```

Chat Component with Signals

```ts

```

### Notable Enhancements:

- **Message Management:** Gone are the days of `BehaviorSubject`. Now, the Signal takes the stage, ensuring on-the-fly updates.
- **Reactive Templates:** Signals directly in templates 
  react instantly to live data changes, all without the need for async 
  pipes or subscription hassles.
- **Trimmed Down Code:** Less is more! Reducing manual work enhances clarity and maintenance.
